Reflection

If I had more time, I would create various locations and allow 
inventory transfers from one location to another. I would make a history 
of the past transactions showing the transfers in and out of a location. 
I would add more details like unit pricing to allow for perpetual inventory 
records. I would allow the user customization like adding/editing fields.
